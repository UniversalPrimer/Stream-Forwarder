Stream Forwarder runs on the streaming server.

Stream Forwarder receives streams and forwards each stream both to the RTMP server and to the storage server.

Stream Forwarder is written in Ruby using Event Machine.

For Ubuntu and the like you can probably install dependencies like this:

  sudo aptitude install ruby-full rubygems

  sudo gem install eventmachine yaml

You need to copy config_example.yaml to config.yaml and edit to suit your needs.

The RTMP server we use is RTMPd (http://rtmpd.com).
The storage server code is not yet on github.

Future versions will support SSL, authentication, more output targets (for other types of streams than RTMP) and possibly UDP.
